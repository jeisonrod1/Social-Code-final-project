        -Posts page: 
                    -In the post section the title the title and date should apply 
                    above the image and not on the side.
                    -The comments field all display false
                    -After the 4th post the post section gets wider and the 
                    channels sections blends into posts
                    -Like and share button doesn't work
                    -Create posts: add image and open editor doesn't work
        -Social Code logo doesn't work as return to home page button
        -User Profile styleing: we could use the dark theme backround color from posts page and than maybe as a top banner 
add       in the background the image from the login page
